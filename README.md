**
Retail Sales and Customer Demographics Data Analysis Project**
Project Overview
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a Retail Sales and Customer Demographics Dataset. The dataset simulates a retail environment, including key features such as customer demographics and transactional data. The goal of this project is to extract meaningful insights about customer behavior, sales trends, and product preferences, which can be leveraged to enhance retail strategies.

**Dataset Description**
The dataset captures customer purchases in a fictional retail environment with the following columns:

Transaction_ID: Unique identifier for each transaction.
Date: Date of the transaction.
Customer_ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Gender: Gender of the customer.
Age: Age of the customer.
Product_Category: Category of the product purchased.
Quantity: Number of items bought.
Price per Unit: The price of each product unit.
Total_Amount: The total transaction amount, calculated as Quantity * Price per Unit.
The dataset simulates typical retail scenarios and allows for various analyses, including demographic influences on sales and product preferences.
