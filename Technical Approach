Technical Approach
This project will be executed using the following tools and steps:

1. Data Exploration and Cleaning:
SQL in BigQuery will be used to query, clean, and aggregate the data for analysis.
Excel will be used for initial data inspection and some manual data processing if necessary.
Tableau will be employed for data visualization to uncover insights and present results in an interactive dashboard.

 Data Analysis Steps:
1.Customer Segmentation:
Group customers by Customer_ID and analyze their total spend, average age, and transaction frequency using SQL.
2.Sales Trend Analysis:
Use SQL queries to aggregate sales over time, broken down by Product Category, Age, and Gender.
3.Demographic Analysis:
Analyze relationships between Gender, Age, and Total_Spent using SQL queries and Tableau visualizations.
4.Top Buyers/Spenders Identification:
Use SQL to rank customers based on total spending and the number of transactions.
